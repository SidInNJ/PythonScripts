For Claude "PDF to CSV Converter Script" (That it provided as a better starting prompt):

        Please provide a Python script that will convert AT&T transactions from a bank statement PDF into a CSV spreadsheet with summary totals.
        Input Requirements:

        File handling:

        Accept optional input filename as command-line parameter
        If no filename provided:

        Look for PDF files in current directory
        If none found, prompt user for filename


        Handle encoding issues with UTF-8


        PDF Data Extraction:

        Format: Bank statement with columns for Date, Number, Description, Withdrawals, Deposits, Balance
        Dates appear as MMDDYY format without separators
        Transaction numbers appear in Description field - don't mistake these for dates
        Skip header rows containing column names
        Handle multi-page PDFs


        Data Processing:

        Convert dates to MM/DD/YYYY format
        Sort by:

        Description (alphabetically)
        Date (chronologically ascending)


        Group similar transactions:

        Primary grouping: Identical descriptions
        Secondary grouping: Descriptions with matching first two words
        Skip single transactions with no matches in summaries




        Summary Totals:

        Add blank line after transactions
        For each group of similar transactions show:

        Label indicating if exact or partial match
        Description
        Number of transactions in group
        Total withdrawals
        Total deposits


        Sort summaries:

        Exact matches first
        Partial matches second




        Output:

        Save as CSV with same base filename
        Include both transactions and summaries
        Print summary totals to console in readable format
        Format numbers with commas and 2 decimal places
